Montoux Athena Library

This Python library is a simple wrapper around boto3, to provide easier access to AWS Athena.
In this library you can inspect databases and tables that have been created in Athena and
perform simple queries to return AWS S3 URIs for results, or load them directly into a Pandas
dataframe.

It's very much work in progress.
